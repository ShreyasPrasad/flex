# flex
A music player built in native Java (JavaFX and object-oriented design). 


Flex is a user-oriented music player app with a simple and elegant user interface. Built using JavaFX, and an objected oriented approach to playlists, music settings, and local folder management.

I'm currently working on adding support for authentication through federated providers (gmail, facebook, etc...)
